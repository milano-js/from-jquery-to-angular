# MilanoJS Talk #2 - 01 Jul 2014 #

In this talk we will write a simple directive in AngularJS based on a jQuery plugin.
We have chosen MasterBlaster plugin ([link](https://github.com/aef-/jquery.masterblaster)), a simple tag manager.

### How to run the code ###

* clone the project
* install npm and bower dependencies
```bash
npm install && bower install
```
* run local server with livereload
```bash
grunt serve
```
* run tests
```bash
grunt test
```
